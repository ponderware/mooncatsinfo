# mooncatsinfo

### Backend Support For MoonCatRescue

This is a simple server which loads data from the MoonCatRescue Ethereum smart contract, compresses it, and serves it to clients.

## MoonCat Renaissance

This package was updated with the intent of getting the MoonCatRescue servers operational again. Minimal changes were made to make it compatible with newer available packages and node versions. It is still a bit old and crusty, maybe a touch rickety even.

## Usage
(you may, but probably don't, have to follow the installation instructions for the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) dependencies)

```bash
$ npm install -g mooncatsinfo
$ mooncatsinfo
```
